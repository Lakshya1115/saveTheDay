# 🚨 **Streak Saver - November 6th Update** 🚨

**Mid Sem-3 exams are happening right now** 🤯 and, to be honest, I'm **freaking out**. 📚  
But hey, what's **wrong with this initiative**? 🤷‍♂️

**My GitHub streak got broken** (yeah, it's already dead),  
but **what’s the harm in keeping that green box alive**? 😎

So here I am, **pushing random stuff** into the repo just to **get that glorious green box** in my streak tab.  
Whatever that's called... It's worth it. ✅

**P.S.** Mid Sem-3 is a whole vibe, but **streak > stress**. 😂
